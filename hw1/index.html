          We don't ship. We're not real.

        <p>
          We sell shirts. We are passionate about selling shirts. But keep in mind we have no infrastructure, supply chain, or mechanism to actually produce these shirts or fulfill these orders. But the shirts will always be real in your imagination.

          Design your own shirt! But help us do that...
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not only do we not sell shirts, but we let you design your won! Eventually. We actually kind of need your help implementing that. If you could build an actual paint style interface that you can make designs that would be great!
